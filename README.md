## Description

Brranching is an interface to many different sources of phylogenetic data (currently only from Phylomatic (http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/), but more sources to come) that allows users to query for phylogenetic data using taxonomic names.  


## Installation

Stable CRAN version


```r
install.packages("brranching")
```

Or dev version


```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/brranching")
```


```r
library("brranching")
```

## Phylomatic


```r
taxa <- c("Poa annua", "Phlox diffusa", "Helianthus annuus")
tree <- phylomatic(taxa=taxa, get = 'POST')
plot(tree, no.margin=TRUE)
```

You can pass in up to about 5000 names. We can use `taxize` to get a random set of plant species names.


```r
library("taxize")
spp <- names_list("species", 200)
out <- phylomatic(taxa = spp, get = "POST")
plot(out, show.tip.label = FALSE)
```
